Project 4: Generate new photograph

Source: CIFAR-10 dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/c/cifar-10)

Note: This project is based on the Generative Adversarial Model (GAN) which
will get covered at the end of this course. So, choose this project only if you are
willing to learn the functionality in advance and prepare the project.

Description:
Machine learning has covered almost all industries and it has helped humans
to mimic human-like behavior. Additionally, there are quite a few tasks where
ML algorithms are proven better than humans where humans have physical limi-
tations to achieve the task. One such interesting area is Image generation. A few
of the fields where image generation can be useful are redressing a person with a
given outfit or glasses, providing measurement of the cloth based on a photo of a
person, identifying the image of a person after 25 years, etc.

The CIFAR-10 dataset (Canadian Institute for Advanced Research) is a collection
of images that are commonly used to train machine learning and computer vision
algorithms. It is one of the most widely used datasets for machine learning rese-
arch. The CIFAR-10 dataset contains 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 different
classes. The 10 different classes represent airplanes, cars, birds, cats, deer, dogs,
frogs, horses, ships, and trucks. There are 6,000 images of each class.

The scope of this project is to generate a new image that is not available in
real life, based on a model trained using the Generative Adversarial Model (GAN).

Project Outcomes:
• Preprocess and clean the data.
• Explore various options of GAN to find the most optimized model.
• Generate a new image with a newly trained algorithm

Deliverables
Each group should deliver:

1. Report (20%)
(a) Explain what you have done and where you are at in the implementation
(b) Report 1: Problem statement and understanding (Nov 8th, 2022)
(c) Report 2: Data pre-processing and choice of approach to implement. Explore the different options (Nov 29th, 2022)
(d) Final Report: Experimental evaluation and results (Dec. 8th, 2022) – Final report should also include the previous two.

Note: Please submit only new content for each submission mentioned above
except the final report. The final report should contain a complete report
with all the content of the previous reports.


2. Code (10%)
(a) Codes must be clean, commented, easy-to-read, executable
(b) Create a GitHub repo and commit your codes there (share the link to the repo in your reports)
(c) Codes will be reviewed using an AI-powered tool, so be careful! You are allowed to use resources like StackOverflow, just make sure that you cite the appropriate resources when you use them.
(d) The deadline for your last commit is Dec 8th, 2022 (11:59 pm)
